## 🧠 About Me

Hey! I'm **Vishal**, a passionate self-taught web developer, productivity nerd, and aspiring digital detective 👨‍💻🕵️‍♂️.  
I may not come from privilege, but I code with hunger. Class 12 student by day, rogue creator by night.

- 🔥 Building [**12th Man**](#-my-projects) — a narrative productivity game inspired by *Fight Club*
- 🎯 Learning Physics, Chemistry & Math with a no-BS, mastery-first mindset
- 🕸️ Obsessing over OSINT, hacking, and the darker corners of the internet (legally 😉)
- 🤖 Working on AI-based planners, gamified Pomodoro apps, and intelligent revision systems
- 🎬 Fan of Mr. Robot, Peter Parker, and psychological thrillers

## 🧭 Mission: Internet Mastery + Class 12 Redemption

I don’t want to just “pass” exams or “learn to code” — I want **revenge** on mediocrity.
I build like it’s war, learn like it’s survival, and fail forward — always.
